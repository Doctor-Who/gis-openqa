Wicked testing in openQA follows earlier test approach done in wicked-testsuite.
Please see: https://github.com/openSUSE/wicked-testsuite

Tests in wicked-testsuite are organized in 9 different groups:
https://github.com/openSUSE/wicked-testsuite/tree/master/features
wicked_1_basic.feature
wicked_2_advanced.feature
wicked_3_physical.feature
wicked_4_combinations.feature
wicked_5_startandstop.feature
wicked_6_ipv6.feature
wicked_7_settings.feature
wicked_8_scripts.feature
wicked_9_aggregation.feature

OpenQA wicked testing follows that structure.
